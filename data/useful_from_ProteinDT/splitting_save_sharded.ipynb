       "Component of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex (complex III or cytochrome b-c1 complex) that is part of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The b-c1 complex mediates electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c. Contributes to the generation of a proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane that is then used for ATP synthesis. Binds 2 heme b groups non-covalently. The cytochrome bc1 complex contains 11 subunits: 3 respiratory subunits (MT-CYB, CYC1 and UQCRFS1), 2 core proteins (UQCRC1 and UQCRC2) and 6 low-molecular weight proteins (UQCRH/QCR6, UQCRB/QCR7, UQCRQ/QCR8, UQCR10/QCR9, UQCR11/QCR10 and a cleavage product of UQCRFS1). This cytochrome bc1 complex then forms a dimer. Heme 1 (or BL or b562) is low-potential and absorbs at about 562 nm, and heme 2 (or BH or b566) is high-potential and absorbs at about 566 nm. Belongs to the cytochrome b family. The full-length protein contains only eight transmembrane helices, not nine as predicted by bioinformatics tools.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1423\n",
